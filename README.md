# Personal Hammerspoon config

Hammerspoon is my main tool for many years, so overtime I changed it a lot, but currently it's pretty stable.

Most interesting/new parts is PushToTalk Spoon. Check it out!

Also I'm using modified version of SpoonInstall which can download Spoon from Source without zip file. Mostly because I don't like to have zips in repo.
